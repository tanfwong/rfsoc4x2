# Experimenting with the RFSoC4x2 board
I just got a [RealDigital RFSoC4x2
board](https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/rfsoc-4x2) via the
[XilinxMD/ Univeristy
Program](https://www.xilinx.com/support/university.html). My immediate
goals are to use the board as a teaching platform for the course
"EEL4511 Real-time DSP" at [University of Florida](www.ece.ufl.edu)
and to do some SDR development.

I'm learning to use the RFSoC4x2 board and using this repository to
jot down my notes on experimenting with it:
